## Features

- **Computer Vision**: Utilizes OpenCV and PIL libraries for image processing and contour detection.
- **Automatic Calculation**: Computes the area of the foot based on a known scale of pixels per centimeter.
- **Visualization**: Displays original images, binary representations, and contour overlays for visual analysis.
- **Measurement Precision**: Ensures accurate measurement of foot dimensions for diverse use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 🐍 (For running the application)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- PIL (`pip install pillow`)
